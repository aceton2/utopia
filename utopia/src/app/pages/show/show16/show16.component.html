		Utopianist Diary<br>
		29 Haus Foke - 1st direction from the east beach<br><br>
		Pushing on the Red Button....<br>
		1000 miles away LIGHT is coming over the ocean...<br>
		Spiral Moving - Without borders.... Feeling free?.... IMAGINATION of the World - Wholeness as a part of blurred <br>
		images.... Colors of the RAINBOW are not the same any more....<br><br>
		26 Haus Muckel - 2nd direction nearby to the Nowhere NOTHING has born from the farthest HORIZON... Behind the <br>
		FANTASY there is a black square - inside it - There was a KEY for dreams....<br>
		Diving into the gray waves<br>
		Desires became wet anyway...<br>

		Winkelschifchen -((Y))th direction to the Room of Thoughts Confusion of the mind....<br>
		Intuition of touching ARTIFICIAL !<br>
		Fragile GLASS as a transformed surface -> Re ected cracks of PARIDISE...<br><br>
		D&uuml;nenstra&szlig;e - Timeless Day - There was No Way<br>
		AS A RESULT OF IMAGINATION : Starting breath - fast and deep... From the fear of STRINGENCY it was a BIRTH of LOVE &<br>
		PEACE... Circular moving into the space:<br>
		Time is moving ...<br>
		From law<-->To high -<br>
		Tide is coming....

		Frozen Shadows of 20 words -<br>
		Washed away from East to North...<br>
		Mirage of the landscape -<br>
		It is the same<-->It is another...<br>
		With "EYS WIDE SHUT" -<br>
		Real Moments became as Surreal Past!<br>
		P.S.<br>
		Every connections based on real observation, real directions and inspirations of the Juist Island...!<br>
		Every SIGNED WORDS have their own utopian owner. So the origin of these words are committed from utopian vocabulary <br>
		and represented as the clues of a big idea - --> "Design your Utopia !"<br>
